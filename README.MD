# Jupiter Proxy

**JupiterSwap** is a decentralized application built on Solana that allows users to swap one token (Token X) for another token (Token Y) using a script. The program uses the Jupiter Aggregator for efficient token swaps.

## Functionality

The core functionality of the Wallex MVP program is to facilitate token swaps on the Solana mainnet:

1. **Token Swap**: Enables swapping a specified amount of `inputToken` (Token X) for `outputToken` (Token Y).
2. **Setting Variables**: You need to set the following variables in the script located at `scripts/swap.ts`:
   - `inputToken`: The token you want to swap (Token X).
   - `outputToken`: The token you want to receive (Token Y).
   - `amountIn`: The amount of `inputToken` to swap.
3. **Display Result**: After the swap is executed, the result (amount of received `outputToken`) is displayed in the console.

## How It Works

1. **Input Parameters**: The user sets the required variables (`inputToken`, `outputToken`, `amountIn`) in the script (`scripts/swap.ts`).
2. **Execution**: The script interacts with the Wallex program to perform the swap.
3. **Validation**: The program verifies the transaction to ensure that:
   - The swap is completed before the specified deadline (set automatically to 1 hour ahead).
   - The amount of received tokens meets the minimum required (this value is obtained from the quote response of the Jupiter API).
4. **Result**: The program transfers the received tokens to the userâ€™s address and displays the result in the console.

## Requirements

- A Solana wallet with sufficient funds to cover transaction fees (should be located at `./test-wallet.json`).
- `inputToken` and `outputToken` must be supported by the Jupiter Aggregator.
- The script must be configured with the correct parameters.

## Usage

1. Navigate to `scripts/swap.ts`.
2. Set the following variables:
   ```ts
   let inputToken = "<TOKEN_X_MINT_ADDRESS>";
   let outputToken = "<TOKEN_Y_MINT_ADDRESS>";
   let amountIn = <AMOUNT_TO_SWAP>;
